## What is this?

For the longest time, this website has just been a placeholder for information
about what I'm currently doing if you happened to stumble across it.  It would
list my latest job, what my research interests where as a PhD student and
various pieces of software that seemed to get older and older.  

I have continued working on projects throughout this time period, but never
really invested in writing down descriptions of them or even publicizing
them properly. For example, I spent a large portion of my free time in 2013
developing a website that could generate reasonable recommendations for
video games. This was supposed to turn into a series of blog posts on what
were the most popular games, how quickly one game would take over the
market, how long people spent playing certain games, etc.  


## Why am I doing this?

First and foremost, this blog is not a set of tutorials on whatever topic I
currently find interesting. I'm going to be treating this much more like a
journal for topics that I find interesting at the current time and directly
relate to projects that I am currently working on. The first of these, will
be about game development and some of the more intricate challenges that I
have been working on for my new game. Hopefully, in the middle there, I will
find some time to write up what I have done for [Steam
Recommender](http://www.steamrecommender.com), but we'll see how long I can
keep this up.
