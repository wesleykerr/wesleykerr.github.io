## Project Description

The objective of this project is to achieve desirable behavior of robotic
swarms. It is our observation that fluids (liquids and gases) have many
desirable properties of motion that could be useful for swarm robotics.  In
particular, fluids (1) are easily deformed, (2) can squeeze through narrow
tubes, and (3) easily rejoin after parting around objects.  Furthermore, (4) by
modifying flow-field variables, such as viscosity or pressure, it is easy to
design and predict the overall fluid flow. Gases have the additional property
that (5) they fill volumes.

For these reasons, we are exploring models of fluid flow for teams of robots
and other vehicles, such as micro-air vehicles and autonomous underwater
vehicles. The particular modeling approaches that we are investigating are <a

kinetic theory.</p>
