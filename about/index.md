I currently work for [Google](http://www.google.com) in the Machine
Intelligence group.  I really enjoy the research opportunities at Google and
exploring the amazing amounts of data that we have access to.

I also run a side project called [Steam
Recommender](http://www.steamrecommender.com).  Many gamers (including myself)
keep their [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com) profiles public and this
allows me to gather data on what games people have been playing.  Powering the
website is a recommendation engine that I've cobbled together and provides
fairly good recommendations.  

Prior to joining Google, I was the Lead Data Scientist at [Riot
Games](http://www.riotgames.com) working within the Insights and Big Data teams
for the wildly popular video game [League of
  Legends](http://www.leagueoflegends.com).  We were very focused on building a
  general purpose recommender system that was capable of online and batch
  learning and able to serve millions of recommendations with horizontal
  scaling.  We were able to deploy a collaborative-filter recommender that
  recommends champions to play or purchase based on who a summoner has been
  playing recently.

I still actively develop games and am currently working on a 2D game that is a
spiritual successor to a game developed as part of a 48 hour game competition
while I was a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Stout.
  [iTanks](../games/itanks/MonkeyGame.html) is a collaboration with Ryan Appel and
  Tegan Moersfelder that was made using the [Monkey
  engine](http://www.monkey-x.com/).
